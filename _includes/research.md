## Research

I currently work on applied machine learning. I am in the _AI for Good_ team at
Element AI, and work on implementing existing or new algorithms to support
humanitarian and environmental work. Our team is building platforms and tools to
support NGOs in their work.

In the past, I worked in applying machine learning in a commercial setting at
_Faculty_, a London-based startup that, amongst other things, completes
consulting projects for organisations.

Before that, I studied visual perception in clinical populations. Many
psychiatric conditions feature unusual sensory processing, which can be caused
by the same underlying processes that are causing core symptoms. I ran
behavioural studies to tap into these underlying processes.
