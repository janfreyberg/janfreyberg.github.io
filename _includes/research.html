          I study visual perception in clinical populations. Many
          psychiatric conditions feature atypical sensory processing,
          which can be caused by the same underlying processes that
          are causing core symptoms. By studying how people see
          the world, I hope to find out more about fundamental
          brain mechanisms in clinical conditions.
          Using vision science to study these conditions has
          the benefit of being cheap, non-invasive, and quick.
