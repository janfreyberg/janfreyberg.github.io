#### **Neuroimaging Widgets** ####

At the 2017 Brainhack Global, I helped out on a project initially started by Bjoern Soergel from Cambridge. We both enjoy using jupyter notebooks, and since we were working on a neuroimaging project at the time, we thought it would be neat to have interactive widgets displaying neuroimaging data in the notebook.

We turned this into a package that works for standard neuroimaging plotting functions, relying on ipywidgets.
