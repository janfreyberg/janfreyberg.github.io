                <strong>Binocular Rivalry</strong>
              </h4>
              <p>
                Binocular rivalry occurs when the two eyes see different images
                (either using mirrors, polarisation, or colored glasses). Rather
                than seeing these images superimposed, observers see a rhythmic
                alternation between them, with periods of superimposition or
                piecemeal images in between.
              </p>
              <p>
                This alternation is thought to be driven by mutual inhibition
                between the two images. I have therefore tried to use it as a
                proxy measure of the Excitation/Inhibition ratio in the brain.

                <strong>Binocular Adaptation</strong>
              </h4>
              <p>
                Given the interesting finding of a slower rate of binocular
                rivalry in autism, I was interested in whether adapting to an
                image - the process in which neural responses to an image reduce
                when seeing it for an extended period - was causing it.
              </p>
              <p>
                I developed a paradigm in which I adapted the viewer to an image
                before binocular rivalry in two ways: at a very basic level, and
                at a slightly higher level.
              </p>
              <p>
                It showed no real difference in adaptation between an autistic
                and a control group, and also proved to be a neat way to study
                contributions of different levels of the visual hierarchy to
                rivalry. You can find a draft of this project here, and try the
                code yourself below.

              <h4>
                <strong>Visual Crowding</strong>
              </h4>
              <p>
                Visual crowding occurs when lots of objects are close to each
                other in peripheral vision. While it's easy to see that there
                are objects in your peripheral vision, it becomes harder to
                identify each individual object.
              </p>
              <p>
                This presents a fundamental limit to perceiving all objects in
                our visual field. Since perception of many details is sometimes
                linked to autism, I recently checked if crowding is weaker in
                autism - which would let more individual objects be perceived.
              </p>
              <p>
                In some ways this represents a follow-up to an earlier project
                I was involved in in which we found slightly more narrowly
                focused attention in autism:

                <strong>Face Categorisation</strong>
              </h4>
              <p>
                I'm also interested in face categorisation. At the moment, I am
                mostly curious about the early stages of face perception, and in
                 particular the simple distinction between a face and a
                 different object. I'm using an experimental paradigm from the
                 <a href="http://face-categorization-lab.webnode.com/">Face
                   Categorisation Lab</a>, who were kind enough to send me their
                 stimuli. The experiment is designed to detect a signature of
                 face processing using steady-state visual evoked potentials.
                 It does so by flashing random images rhythmically.
                 Periodically, the image flashed will be a face, and at the
                 frequency at which faces are shown, a clear response can be
                 detected.
